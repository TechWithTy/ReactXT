# React XT Documentation

Welcome to React XT, a highly condensed pseudo-code language for rapid and type-safe web development. React XT simplifies React programming by providing a succinct syntax, integrated state management, and props system with TypeScript's static type checking.

## Overview

React XT aims to streamline the development process by reducing boilerplate, enhancing readability, and ensuring type safety. It combines the component-based architecture of React with the static type checking of TypeScript, optimized for both developers and Language Learning Models (LLMs).

## Installation

React XT is a conceptual language framework. To simulate its environment, ensure you have a modern JavaScript environment with React and TypeScript setup.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install react typescript

# Using yarn
yarn add react typescript
```

## Getting Started

### Creating a Component

Define a new component with its props and return type:

```typescript
component <ComponentName>({ props: <PropsType> }): <ReturnType> => {
  return <JSX>;
};
```

### Managing State

Simplify state management within your component:

```typescript
state <StateName>: <StateType> = <InitialState>;
updateState(<NewStateValue>);
```

### Using Props

Pass and receive props with type safety:

```typescript
type <PropsType> = {
  prop1: <Type1>,
  optionalProp?: <Type2>,
};

component <ComponentName>({ prop1, optionalProp }: <PropsType>): <ReturnType> => {
  return <JSX>;
};
```

### Conditional Rendering

Easily manage conditional rendering within your components:

```typescript
component <ComponentName>({ }): <ReturnType> => {
  return (
    <div>
      {condition ? <ComponentIfTrue /> : <ComponentIfFalse />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Utilizing Hooks

Create and use hooks with clear type annotations:

```typescript
hook useState<HookType>(initialValue: <HookType>): [<HookType>, (newValue: <HookType>) => void] => {
  return [stateValue, updateFunction];
};
```

## Type Checking

Ensure all components, props, and state management structures are strongly typed using TypeScript for a robust, error-free development experience.

## Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Utilize ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style and quality.
- **Readability**: Write clear, understandable code that both humans and LLMs can easily process.
- **Efficiency**: Aim for minimal verbosity while maintaining comprehensive type safety.
