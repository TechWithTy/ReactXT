# React VLL Language

## Overview

React VLL (Very Low-Level) is a minimalist programming language designed to streamline the development of React applications at a low level. It focuses on efficient component design, state management, and type checking to overcome common React development pitfalls.

## Features

- **Type Checking**: Built-in type checking to prevent runtime errors and enforce data integrity.
- **Immutable State Management**: Encourages the use of immutable state to ensure predictability and optimize performance.
- **Simplified Component Design**: Minimizes the complexity of component structures.
- **Efficient State Management**: Provides tools and patterns to manage state efficiently, avoiding overly complex or inefficient state structures.

## Installation

React VLL requires a specific compiler to convert VLL code into executable React code. Installation instructions will be provided once the compiler is available.

## Getting Started

### Defining a Component

Define components using the `C[id]` syntax, where `id` is a unique identifier for the component.

```vll
C[1]  Component with ID 1
```

### Adding Props with Type Checking

Define props with types using the `P[id:key:type]` syntax.

```vll
P[1:name:string]  Prop `name` of type `string` for component 1
```

### Managing Immutable State

Initialize state with `S[id:key:type:value]`, ensuring immutability and efficient updates.

```vll
S[1:message:string:Hello, World!]  Immutable state `message`
```

### Updating State

Update state in an immutable fashion with `U[id:key:value]`.

```vll
U[1:message:Goodbye, World!]  Update state `message`
```

### Rendering Components

Define rendering instructions using `R[id:element:children]`.

```vll
R[1:div:message]  Render `div` with `message` state as content
```
### Using Context
 Define a context with ID 1
C[1]  Context with ID 1

 Define a context provider component with ID 2
C[2]  Context Provider with ID 2

 Define a prop for the context provider to pass the context value
P[2:value:string]  Prop `value` of type `string` for component 2

 Initialize an immutable state with the context value
S[1:contextValue:string:Default Context Value]  Immutable state `contextValue`

 Update the context value when the component mounts
OnMount(() => {
  U[1:contextValue:Provided Context Value]
})

 Render the context provider component with the context value prop
R[2:ContextProvider:contextValue]

 Define a context consumer component with ID 3
C[3]  Context Consumer with ID 3

 Render the context consumer component
R[3:ContextConsumer]

### Rendering Components Use Effect
C[1]  Component with ID 1

P[1:message:string]  Prop `message` of type `string` for component 1

S[2:mounted:boolean:false]  Immutable state `mounted`

U[1:message:Hello, World!]  Update state `message`

OnMount(() => {
   Set mounted state to true when the component mounts
  U[2:mounted:true]
})
Explanation:

We define a component with ID 1.
We define a prop message of type string for component 1.
We initialize an immutable state mounted with a boolean value of false.
We update the message state to "Hello, World!".
Instead of using useEffect, we use a hypothetical OnMount directive or syntax to execute a callback function when the component mounts, which updates the mounted state to true.

@pageTitle: My Page
@description: This page displays dynamic data fetched from the server.
@keywords: Next.js, React, Server-side Rendering
Import necessary modules and utilities
import { fetchDataFromServer } from '..utilsapi';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

 Import component from another file
I[1:Button:..componentsButton]  Import Button component from '..componentsButton'

 Define a component
C[1]  Component with ID 1

 Export the component
E[1:ComponentName]  Export Component with ID 1 as 'ComponentName'
 Define the page layout
C[1]  Page Layout with ID 1
R[1:Header]
R[2:Main]
R[3:Footer]

Define the page component
C[2]  Page Component with ID 2

 Define state to store fetched data
S[1:data:string]  Immutable state `data`

 Fetch data from the server when the component mounts
OnMount(() => {
  U[1:data:Fetching data...]  Update state `data`
  fetchDataFromServer()
    .then((response) => {
      U[1:data:response]  Update state `data` with fetched data
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      U[1:data:Error fetching data]  Update state `data` with error message
    });
})

 Render the page component
R[2:PageComponent]

 Define the page title and metadata
 @pageTitle: My Page
 @description: This page displays dynamic data fetched from the server.

## Addressing Common Pitfalls

### Poor Component Design

React VLL encourages minimalist component design, reducing the likelihood of bloated and complex components.

### Inefficient State Management

By design, React VLL promotes efficient state management through immutable state patterns, simplifying state updates and component re-renders.

### Overly Complex State

The language's syntax and conventions guide developers to define state in a straightforward manner, avoiding complexity.

### Not Using Immutable State

React VLL's state management system is built on the principle of immutability, ensuring that state mutations are predictable and efficient.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Components Small and Focused**: Define components with a single responsibility.
- **Use Type Checking**: Leverage React VLL's type checking to prevent type-related bugs.
- **Immutable State Updates**: Always update state immutably for consistency and performance.
- **Simplify State**: Avoid nesting and complex structures in your state definitions.
