## Overview

React XT aims to streamline the development process by reducing boilerplate, enhancing readability, and ensuring type safety. It combines the component-based architecture of React with the static type checking of TypeScript, optimized for both developers and Language Learning Models (LLMs).

## Installation

React XT is a conceptual language framework. To simulate its environment, ensure you have a modern JavaScript environment with React and TypeScript setup.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install react typescript

# Using yarn
